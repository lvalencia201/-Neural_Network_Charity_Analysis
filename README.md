# Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

â€¢	The loan prediction analysis has forty-four columns and five rows. The merged data frame shows the loan tier, status, and amount.
#Anyalsis
# The purpose of this analysis is to show the certain incomes and loan amounts. Giving the user a set amounts and showing which loans are successful.
# Results:

o	What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
o	The targets are the column heading as this is important data to show if the loan would be succesful
o	What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? Neural network
o	What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? EIN and Name were removed from the dataframe as they were not needed.

# 	How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
o	Two neural layers
# Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
o	I was not able to achieve over 75 accuracy.
# What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
o	Change different sequential layers.
